// steps:

// 1. sort the given position array in ascending order.
// 2. calculate time taken by each car to reach the target.
// 3. store the time taken by last car in a var lets say prev
// 4. loop through the second last element of the position array
// 5. check whether the time taken by this car is less than the prev then they will form a fleet.
// 6. update the prev as the time taken by that last fastest car which is the current one.
